Linux g77 does not accept SEP's memory allocation
tricks.  As a result we now preprocess saw77 code
into fortran90.

The conversion is not perfect. The most common
difference is that implicit none is set not only
in subroutines but also in the main program.

If you are using another f77 compiler you can try
compiling with f77 by setting RATF90=no in the Makefile
