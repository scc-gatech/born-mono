=head1 DESCRIPTION


Moves file pointers inside a given SEPLIB dataset


=head1 COMMENTS


The tag argument is either the string "in","out", or any tag appropriate for
use with auxin() or auxout().  
This means either an explicit filename or a command
line redirect parameter tag=filename.  

sseek() sets the seek pointer associated with the open seplib dataset
or  device referred to by the tag according to the
value supplied for whence.  whence must be one of  the  following 
constants defined in <unistd.h>:

               SEEK_SET
               SEEK_CUR
               SEEK_END

If whence is SEEK_SET, the seek pointer  is  set  to  offset
bytes.   If  whence  is SEEK_CUR, the seek pointer is set to
its current location plus offset.  If  whence  is  SEEK_END,
the seek pointer is set to the size of the file plus offset.
