=head1 PARAMETERS


=over 4


=item  x      -complex   

       input/output array

=item  lx     -int       

       length of real vectors

=item  nx     -int       

       number of vectors; must be a power of 2

=item  isign  -int       

       sign of sqrt(-1)

=item  scale  -double    

       scale factor; sqrt(2./lx) conserves energy

=item  mode   -int       

       1 for nx real to nx/2 complex
       2 for nx real to nx/2+1 complex
       -1 for nx/2 complex to nx real
       -2 for nx/2+1 complex to nx real

=head1 DESCRIPTION


     Real fast Fourier transform between vectors of an array.  
     Rvfft takes a 2D panel and does a real to complex or 
     viceversa fast fourier transform across the second dimension, 
     of all the time samples. The arguments are as follows:
