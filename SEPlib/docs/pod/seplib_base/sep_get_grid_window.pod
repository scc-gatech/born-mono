=item   char* - tag_history      

                tag of History File

=item   int* - n_dim_grid	  

        Number of Dimensions in the Grid Cube

=item   int* - n_grid

=head1 OUTPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item   int* - header_numbers  

        array containing Header Record Numbes of dimensions
        n_wind[0],n_wind[1],..n_wind[n_dim_grid-2]


=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE


 -2= if the values in n_wind, f_wind, j_wind are incorrect

 -1= if fails for other reasons

 0= if successful

 +1= if tag_history is a Sep77 History File but has no GFF file

=head1 DESCRIPTION


   Read gridding information.

=head1 COMMENTS


   Thes routines are based on the sep_window routine that it is the kernel
   of the new sreed_window and srite_window routines.
   ATTENTION: Since the first dimension of the grid is the first axis
              of the data record only the parameter for dimensions >=2
              are specified in n_wind,f_wind,d_wind.
