=head1 NAME


hclose - close the seplib output history file

=head1 SYNOPSIS


	void hclose ()

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Closes the stdout SEPLIB history file

=head1 COMMENTS


The end of a history file is delimited by a ctrl D (octal 004) so that
seismic data can be placed in back of it e.g. when passing data down a
pipe.  Hclose does this and must be called after all additions to the
output header and before writing output data.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS


One of the functions of the include file <sep.wrapup> is to check
that the header has been closed before the program finishes.

=head1 BUGS

The seplib I/O routines, such as rite, srite, do not check to make
sure hclose has been called before writing to output.
