=head1 NAME


Sep2segy - Convert from SEPlib3d to  segy


=head1 SYNOPSIS


Sep2segy < stdout tape=   [pars]


=head1 INPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item  tape    -file

       input tape device or seg-y filename (see notes)

=item verbose  - int

      [0] silent, 1= echo every vblock traces

=item vblock  - int

      [50]   echo every vblock traces whtn verbose option set

=item buff  -  int

   1		for buffered device (9-track reel tape drive)	

   0 possibly useful for 8mm EXABYTE drive	

=item  conv  -  int

	1 convert	=0 don't convert to IBM format			

=item create_reel  - int

  [0] whether (1) or not(0) to create header rather than read from disk  


=item  hfile - file

	hfile=header	ebcdic card image header file			

=item bfile  -  file

	bfile=binary	binary header file				

=item trmin  -  int

  1 first trace to write					

=item	trmax  -  int

  INT_MAX  last trace to write			       

=item endian - int

 [1] 0 for little-endian machines (PC's, DEC,etc...)

=item errmax - int

   0	allowable number of consecutive tape IO errors	


=item format - int

		override value of format in binary header file	

=item nsamp_max   - int

       By default each trace is assumed to be SU_NFLTS (1,000,000+)
       in size and a copy of that length is done for each trace.
       Set this to something more reasonalbe (2000) for a massive speed up.

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Converts from SEP to segy formats


=head1 NOTES


 Note: The header files may be created with  'segyhdrs'.		

 Note: For buff=1 (default) tape is accessed with 'write', for buff=0	

	tape is accessed with fwrite. Try the default setting of buff=1 

 for all tape types.						

 Caveat: may be slow on an 8mm streaming (EXABYTE) tapedrive		

 Warning: segyread or segywrite to 8mm tape is fragile. Allow time	

	   between successive reads and writes.				

 Precaution: make sure tapedrive is set to read/write variable blocksize

	   tapefiles.
