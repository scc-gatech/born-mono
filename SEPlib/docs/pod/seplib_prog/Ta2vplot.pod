=head1 COMMENTS


    color= one of {I,i,F,R,W,G} for the canned Movie-style color tables. You
    may also append a 'C' to make clipped values show up Red (ie color=IC is
    like color=I but with clipped values flagged). You will need to have
    nreserve at least 3 for this option to work, since you have to leave the
    normal vplot 'Red' (vplot default color 2) as a possibility.
    Alternatively, you may also specify a color of the format RGB,
    (i.e. color=332) where each of R,G, and B is the integer number of bits
    to allot to that primary. This is meant for esize=3, but it also makes
    funky color tables when esize=1.
    Finally, if 'color' is a text string longer than 2 characters and
    does not begin with a digit, it will be taken as the name of a color
    table. (Color tables have lines of the form 'color_number red green blue',
    where 0 <= color_number <= 255 and 0. <= red, green, and blue <= 1.
    Anything not set will be black. Odd-numbered color table entries between
    1 and 253, inclusive, will be the first lost if the output device doesn't
    have enough allocatable colors.)
