=head1 NAME


Scat , Merge , Cat-  Concatenate SEP77 datasets, 3 names for exactly the same code.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


  Merge axis=3 space=[y/n] Header1 Header2 Header3 ... > out.H

=head1 INPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item   Header   - files   

        seplib history header files to merge.

=item   axis     - int    

        [3]  axis number to merge (1,2,3)

=item   space    - char  

        [y] leave space between merged data to make it easy to tell
            where one file ends and the next begins in merged movies
            default: space=y for Merge, space=n for Cat

=item   nspace   - int    

        number of traces in the space
        (defaults to something reasonable).

=item   n1       - int   

        if n1=-1 this means that the data is simply read 
        until EOF for each file; this is like using 'cat' on 
        the individual data files. Note n1=-1 implies axis=3 space=n

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Merge seplib header and data file to stdout. Merge is a modified
version of Cat (the same code, but with a perl script on the front end to 
fix some problems). Scat is the same thing.


=head1 COMMENTS


    Note, a header provided on stdin will be used. This was not true
    in previous versions. I.e. this will work!
    Myprog <data.H | Merge axis=2 data2.H > out.H
