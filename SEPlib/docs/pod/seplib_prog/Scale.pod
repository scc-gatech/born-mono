=head1 NAME


Clip,Scale - compute clip on a dataset and apply it if requested

=head1 SYNOPSIS


  Clip pclip=98 dclip=1 retry=y chop=no to=zero clip= <  in.H > out.H

  Scale  <  in.H > out.H axis=12

=head1 INPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item  pclip      -   int      

       [98]: clip percentile  [98] for Clip, [100] for Scale

=item  dclip    -   float    

       [1.]: scale on clip (the maximum value of the data will be dclip)

=item  scale_to    -   float    

       [1.]: scale  the data so the maximum value is this

=item  rscale,dscale       -   float     

       Set the scale value yourself

=item  clip       -   float     

       Set the clip value yourself

=item  retry      -   char     

       [y]: If the clip turns out zero, the program will try again with 
			a higher pclip if the input file is not all zeroes. Defaults
      to no for Scale, yes for Clip.

=item  chop       -   char*    

       [no]:     values are not cliped.
       less:     all values less than or equal to the clip value will be changed.
       greater:  all values greater than the clip value will be changed.
       to:       What the above values are changed to a value, or 'clip'.
       clip:     if chop=g
                (The original sign is multiplied by this value,
                so a positive value of to preserves the original sign)
       Defaults to [no] for Clip, [yes] for Scale

=item n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6   -   int    

      standard SEP cube dimensions.

=item axis - int

      Sub cube to do individual clip/scale operations on. Defaults to
      the entire dataset

=item max_size - int 

       [50] Maximum memory to use  in megabytes

=item j  - int

       [nsize/esize/max_size]  - Subsamples the dataset to calculate
        clip values. For Scale option the entire dataset is used.

=head1 DESCRIPTION


  Clip - compute clip value based on all the data and put it on the header,
               and do various sorts of clipping if requested.

  Scale - compute maximum on a given sub-cube and standardize
          the entire dataset to maximum of dclip

=head1 NOTES


   Only Scale option available on complex data
