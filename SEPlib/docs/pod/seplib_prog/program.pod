Aniso2d - anisotropic modeling


=head1 SYNOPSIS


Aniso2d  par=Par < Hsourcefn  > Hverticalgeophone


=head1 INPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item    moduli - file

        velocity model file (c11,c13,c33,c14, and rho ) (next 4 pars
        from this file

=item   n1   - integer

        # of z grid points (becomes nz in the program) max=400

=item   n2   - integer

        # of x grid points (becomes nz in the program) max=400

=item   d1   - real

        z grid point spacing (becomes dz in the program)

=item   d2   - real

        x grid point spacing (becomes dx in the program)
        The constants are in order c11,c13,c33,c44,rho and
        are stored nz(fast) by nx

=item  Hsource - file

       Source function file (next two pars from this file)

=item  n1 - integer

       length of source

=item  d1- real

       time sample interval (this will be used for calculations)
       so it should be within stability limits

=item  nt - integer

       number of time steps to run, max=4000

=item  nsrc- integer    #

        of shots to make (default=1)

=item  src_1 - integer

       Position of first source (in grid points)

=item  src_type - integer

       vertical force =1; horizontal =2; shear source =3
       explosive force=4

=item  src_inc  - integer

       shot increment (in x grid points) default=1

=item  group_1  - integer

       Position of first receiver for first shot default=1

=item  ngroup   - integer

       Number of receivers default=nx

=item  src_depth- integer

       Shot depth (grid points)

=item  geo_depth- integer

       depth of geophones (in grid points)

=item  surf_type- integer

       free surface (default) =1; absorbing =0

=item  snap_i   - integer

       number of time steps between snapshots

=item  rollalong- integer

       receiver spread rollalong with the
       shots? 1=yes=default; 0=no

=item  vpmax    - real

       maximum velocity in model (optional stability check)
       for stability vpmax*dt/dx <.5
       since anisotropic sqrt(max(c11,c33)/rho)*dt/dx <.5
       for no dispersion (vmin/fmax)/dx >2.8
