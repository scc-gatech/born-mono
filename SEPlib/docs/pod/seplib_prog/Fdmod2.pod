Fdmod2 - Finite-Difference MODeling (2nd order) for acoustic wave equation

=head1 USAGE


Fdmod2 <vfile >wfile nx= nz= tmax= xs= zs= [optional parameters]	

=head1 PARAMETERS


=over 4

stdin  - sepfile

  		file containing velocity[nx][nz]		

stdout - sepfile

		file containing waves[nx][nz] for time steps	

tmax  - float

			maximum time					

src_file - sepfile

   file (2,nsrc) containg src locations (z,x)


xs  - float*

			x coordinates of sources				

zs	- float*	

    z coordinates of source				

nt  - int 

 [1+tmax/dt]  number of time samples (dt determined for stability)

mt  - int 

 [1]		number of time steps (dt) per output time step	

fmax  -float

[vmin/(10.0*h)]  maximum frequency in source wavelet		

fpeak  -float

[0.5*fmax]	peak frequency in ricker wavelet		

dfile- sepfile		

  input file containing density[nx][nz]		

vsx - float			

  [o2] x coordinate of vertical line of seismograms	

hsz - float			

   [o1] z coordinate of horizontal line of seismograms	

vsfile -sepfile	

  [none] 	output file for vertical line of seismograms[nz][nt]

hsfile -sepfile	

  [none] 	output file for horizontal line of seismograms[nx][nt]

ssfile -sepfile		

  [none] output file for source point seismograms[nt]	

verb -int

  [0]		=1 for diagnostic messages, =2 for more		

abs - int[4]

  [1,1,1,1] 		Absorbing boundary conditions on top,left,bottom,right

			sides of the model. 0,1,1,1 for free surface condition on the top		

pml_max - float

  [1000.0]       PML absorption parameter                        

pml_thick - int

 [0]           half-thickness of pml layer (0 = do not use PML)

=head1 NOTES



1. This is sufdmod2 for SEPlib 


2. The sources specification order is

  a. src_file - seplib file containing source locations

  b. xs=3,4,5 zs=4,5,6  command list of sources

  c. oxs= dxs= nxs= ozs= dzs nzs - which will increase the dimensionality
    of the output by 1 ( ., , nxz, nzs)


Notes:								
This program uses the traditional explicit second order differencing	
method. 								

Two different absorbing boundary condition schemes are available. The 
first is a traditional absorbing boundary condition scheme created by 
Hale, 1990. The second is based on the perfectly matched layer (PML)	
method of Berenger, 1995.
