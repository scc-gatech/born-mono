=head1 NAME


Operplot - plots set of samples

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plots a one-, two- or, three-dimensional set of samples.
The samples are represented as shaded boxes and plotted
numerical values.  The input is a float dataset, not the output of Taplot 
or Byte.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


<in.H  Operplot  [options]  | Tube

=head1 INPUT PARAMETERS


=over 4

=item outline - int 

      [0] =plot outlines on boxes with pure 1.0 and 0.0 values
      1=do not plot outlines
      If outline=0, pure 0.0 values are plotted transparently.
      This option is used for displaying fixed values of 
      calculated filters.

=item numbers   - int 

      [0] -plot the values of the samples on the tops of the box
      1 - do not plot the sample values

=item boxes     - int 

      [0]-plot the boxes with the sample values indicated with
      shading.
      1-plot only the sample values without the shaded box.

=item title     - char*  

      plot title

=item label1,label2,label3 -char*    

      axes labels

=item labelsz- int      

      [8]  label size

=item hival  - float   

      highest amplitude to plot, defaults to highest value
      on the input

=item loval  - float   

      lowest amplitude to plot, defaults to lowest value 
      on the input

=item xscale  - float   

      [1.]  <1. for smaller plots, narrow plots, etc.

=item yscale - float   

      [1.]  <1. for smaller plots, narrow plots, etc.

=head1 COMMENTS


   Convert to postscript with color=y force=y to maintain the shading of
   the boxes.  While this routine used Ta2vplot's raster color set, it 
   does not use the raster calls that are converted to PostScript rasters,
   thus the color=y is required.
