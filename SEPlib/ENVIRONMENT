							SETTING UP THE SEP ENVIRONMENT


Before running SEPlib do the following:
----------------------
create ~/.datapath

SEPlib files are composed of ascii/binary pairs.  The ascii portion describes
the data (the size, the type, and the location of the binary). The binary
portion is the actual data.  The two are separated to allow processing to be
done in a centralized location (a home directory for example) while the data
is written where ever there is space.
The datapath file tells SEPlib where to put binary data and should look
something like this:

-------------------------
datapath=/scrka3/bob/;/scrka2/bob/
spur     datapath=/scrka2/bob/
oas      datapath=/scrsa1/bob/
vesuvio  datapath=/SDA/bob/
santorin datapath=/scrsa4/bob/
--------------------------------------

By default SEPlib first checks the command line for  datapath=,
then the directory where the program is run for a  .datapath file,
and finaly the home directory.  The above  .datapath files tells SEPlib
to put binary data by default in  /scrka3/bob and if it runs out of space
in  /scrka2/bob, but when on the computer "santorin"
to put the data in  /scrsa4/bob.


setenv VPLOTSPOOLDIR  /tmp

The next step is to tell SEPlib where to put temporary vplot files.  It
is best to put these in a location such as  /tmp/
which is periodically cleaned.

setenv SEPINC includedir 
The final step is only necessary if you want to compile and run programs
from SEP reports, theses, or books.  This environmental variable is needed
by our  Makefile's to find out its compile and install rules. 
It should be set to the location of the SEP include files.


setenv VPLOTFONTDIR includedir/
The location of the vplot fonts.  Again set this to the location
of the SEP include files.

In Europe you migt want to set

setenv DEFAULT_PAPER_SIZE  The default paper size (a3)

setenv DEFAULTS_PAPER_UNITS 'c' For centimeters rather than inches


Add the mandir and the bindir you specified to your
MANPATH and PATH variables.
