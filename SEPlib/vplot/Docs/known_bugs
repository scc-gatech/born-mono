Each directory should contain a "known_bugs" file.
If anyone wants to fix any of them for me, be my guest. If you fix
any bugs or add any useful enhancements to the original distribution,
please let me know. Well-debugged device drivers for new devices should
be posted, but make sure that it passes "All_tests" first.

Comments about bugs in documentation:

	I don't KNOW of any, but I expect they're there. Of course,
	since nobody reads the documentation anyway, it doesn't matter.
	Whenever I notice people having trouble with a piece of the
	documentation, I try to make it more explicit to help them out.
	Unfortunately, this means that the documentation keeps getting
	longer and longer, and people are less and less willing to wade
	through it in the first place. I've also been told that this
	documentation reminds people of some sort of legal document...
	Well, it's better than no documentation at all.

	I really despise troff and so didn't use it to make vplothacker.doc
	on purpose.

General comments about bugs in device drivers:

	Different devices were supported by different people. Many people
	are content to write code that "mostly" works, and can NOT be coerced
	into finishing the job. I am distributing such code as well, even
	though it isn't perfect. I have tried to mention all such problems
	that I know of in the corresponding "known_bugs" files.
	There are probably also some things "hard_wired" into some of the
	device-dependent makefiles that shouldn't be.

*Sigh*
