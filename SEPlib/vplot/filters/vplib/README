This program, along with plas and pldb, serves as a "poor man's"
vplot editor. By using with this program such generic options as
erase=o, hshift, vshift, scale, frame=y, xwmin, etc, you can combine
plots, move them around, add frames, change their size, clip them,
etc, etc, and save the result into a new vplot file.

Plas and pldb allow you to do minor surgery by hand. The 'o' command
allows you to shift objects around intact.
