Generic Byte-Deep or Byte-triple Raster Device

This Vplot filter outputs a byte-deep or byte-triple binary raster image,
with whatever dimensions you request. There is one 2-D image produced for
each frame in the Vplot input. (Break commands will also cause the image
to be written.) If esize=1, the "colfile" gives the (red,green,blue) color
value associated with each byte value in the raster image. Only byte values
that are multiples of "colormult" will be used (the Movie program here at
Stanford only wants even-valued bytes, since it uses odd-valued ones for
its own purposes).

Raspen will create a file to put the raster image in FOR YOU if you
don't redirect it yourself, since you probably don't want to experience
what happens when you dump a huge binary raster file to your terminal.
