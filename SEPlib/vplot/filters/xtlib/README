Vplot filter for X11R4, written using the X toolkit (Xt)


Author - Steve Cole

The Xtpen source has a long history. The starting point was the code
for Sunpen, the Sunview vplot filter. I converted this code to XView using
a sun-supplied conversion script. Then I supplemented that with original
XView code, especially for colormap handling. Then I removed the dependance
on pixrect and pixwin graphics, adding some Xlib graphics calls from 
X11pen, another X11 vplot filter, and by adding new Xlib calls, particularly
for raster. Then I changed from using XView to Xt.

I would like to acknowledge the people who have worked on the vplot
filters on which xtpen is based:

sunpen:	Joe Dellinger, Jean-Luc Guiziou, Clement Kostov, Rick Ottolini,
	Steve Cole
x11pen:	Stew Levin, Dave Nichols, Rick Ottolini
xvpen: Dave Nichols, Steve Cole

Rewritten - Dave Nichols

I modified the filter to keep a copy of all images plotted, you can then run
them in a movie loop. This involved rewriting the file and frame handling
routines but keeping the basic vplot plotting routines.

Lots of new options, should run movie pretty fast now.
Added a message window.
Interact should work.

Look at XTpen.keypad for an example of binding the keypad to skip to a 
particular frame instantly. Look at XTpen for an example of using xtpen
to draw full-screen images useful for shooting slides off the workstation
screen, or for demo purposes.

The latest version of xtpen allows you to set its default behaviour using
the X-resource mechanism. Here is the correspondence between command line
parameters and resource names as given in the self doc.

Many parameters may have their defaults set in the Xresource database;

here are the equivalent names:

  option name          X-Resource name         Type
  ===========          ===============         ====
  stretchy              XTpen.stretchy         Boolean
  images                XTpen.useImages        Boolean
  pixmaps               XTpen.usePixmaps       Boolean
  buttons               XTpen.showButtons      Boolean
  labels                XTpen.showLabels       Boolean
  want_text             XTpen.showText         Boolean
  numcol                XTpen.numCol           int
  pause                 XTpen.pause            int
 
 
At SEP, to set personal defaults you should put resource definitions in your
~/Setup/Xdefaults file. Here are some lines from my file.
 
XTpen.stretchy:  True
XTpen.showText:  False
XTpen.pause:     1
 
These lines make xtpen start up in "stretchy" mode, remove the text
window (messages go to your terminal), and have a pause of 1 second between
frames (a value of -1 means stop between frames.)
