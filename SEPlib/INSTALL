									INSTALLING SEPlib


SEPlib uses a GNU-style configure mechanism for installation.
This installation mechanism has been tested on:
-  Linux (Redhat 8.0,9)
-  IRIX6.5
-  Solaris
-  MacOs
-  PC (CYGWIN)


Follow the following steps to install SEPlib

-  Download the software, ftp://sepftp.stanford.edu/pub/sep-distr/seplib-5.0.tar.gz
-  gunzip seplib-6.3z.0 -c |tar xf -
-  cd seplib-6.3.0
-  ./configure
-  gmake install

Following the above procedure should install the core seplib libraries
and programs into the directory  /usr/local/SEP.

My suggestion is to start from one of the files in doc/config_examples.
These provide a configuration and compile mechanism for several different
platforms/options.


[--prefix=/other/directory]     Specify another directory to install SEPlib in

[--bindir,--mandir,--includedir,--libdir]
   Location to put the binaries,  manual pages, include files, and libraries.
   If you are going to try to compile SEP reports, old SEPlib code, etc. it
   is important that you set these rather than doing copy or mv commands. 
   See MAKERULES for more details. The directories default to
   default to [prefix]/bin, [prefix]/include, [prefix]/man, [prefix]/lib
  

[--with-local]              Install the less tested, newer portions of SEPlib
[--with-fftw]               Compile with FFTW3.0 support
[--with-omp]                Compile codes with OMP support
[--with-mpi]                Compile with MPI support
[--with-file-2gb]           Limit files to 2GB 
[--with-su=/su/directory]       Compile SU support 

[--with-mansupport]            some systems don't include the
                                packages neqn, tbl, etc.  If your system
                                does, use this option


If you run into problems (for example you need to add an additional library
path when compiling programs) you can often solve your problem by setting 
environmental variables that the configure script will then use. For example:


[FC]         The Fortran compiler
[LDFLAGS]    Directories and libraries to link when compiling C programs
[FCLDFLAGS]  Directories and libraries to link when compiling Fortran programs
[CFLAGS]     Flags to pass to the C compiler
[LIBS]       C Libs to include by default
[FCLIBS]     Fortran libs to include by default
[CPPFLAGS]   C Processor flags
[PERL]       Perl location(is /usr/bin isn't before /usr/sbin this is advisable)
[FFTW_FCLD]  FFTW fortran linking flags
[OMP_FCFLAGS] Fortran OMP compile flags 
[OMP_FCLD]    Fortran OMP link flags 
[MPI_FLAGS]   Mpi compile flags
[MPI_LD]     Mpi linking flags
[PPM_FLAGS]  PPM compiling flags
[PPM_LD]     PPM linking flags
